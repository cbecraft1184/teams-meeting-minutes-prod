---

## The Market Problem

### What Organizations Face Today

Large enterprises conducting thousands of Microsoft Teams meetings face a costly, manual documentation challenge:

**Current State:**
- Administrative staff spend **30-60 minutes per meeting** creating minutes manually
- Documentation quality varies by individual, creating **compliance risks**
- Action items get lost, decisions are forgotten, knowledge scatters
- Organizations with **50,000+ employees cannot scale** manual documentation
- Regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government) **require complete meeting records**

**Business Impact for Typical 10,000-Employee Enterprise:**
- 2,000+ meetings per week requiring documentation
- 1,000+ hours per week spent on manual work
- **$2.6M annual labor cost** ($50/hour fully-loaded)
- Compliance risk exposure from incomplete records
- Lost productivity from missed action items

**Market Gap:** No enterprise-grade automated solution exists for Microsoft Teams despite 280M+ users globally.

---

## The Solution Concept

### What IBM Would Deliver

A **commercial enterprise SaaS platform** that autonomously handles the complete meeting minutes lifecycle:

**Core Capabilities:**
1. **Automatic Capture** - Webhook integration with Microsoft Teams detects completed meetings, retrieves recordings and transcripts
2. **AI Processing** - Azure OpenAI generates professional minutes (summary, decisions, action items)
3. **Approval Workflow** - Built-in review/edit process with audit trail
4. **Automated Distribution** - Email delivery to attendees with DOCX/PDF attachments
5. **Secure Archival** - SharePoint integration with proper classification and metadata
6. **Enterprise Access Control** - Azure AD group-based permissions for 100,000+ users

**Key Differentiator:** Fully autonomous operation - users continue normal Teams usage, system works in background with zero behavior change required.

### Technology Foundation

**Integration Stack:**
- Microsoft Graph API (webhook-based event capture)
- Azure Active Directory (SSO, group permissions)
- SharePoint Online (document archival)
- Azure OpenAI Service (AI processing)

**Infrastructure:**
- Cloud-hosted SaaS (AWS or Azure)
- Enterprise-grade security (SOC 2, FedRAMP-ready)
- Scalable to 300,000+ concurrent users
- Multi-tenant architecture with data isolation

**Development Status:**
- Core workflow engine: Production-ready
- Microsoft integrations: Complete and tested
- AI processing: Operational
- Remaining work: UI polish, testing, compliance certification (16-20 weeks to GA)

## Alternative Scenarios

### If IBM Does Not Proceed

**Market Impact:**
- Competitor (likely startup or Microsoft) captures $280M market
- IBM misses first-mover opportunity in emerging category
- Microsoft partnership weakened (no joint innovation)

**Financial Impact:**
- $26.5M foregone profit (3-year)
- Loss of strategic positioning in enterprise AI automation

**Strategic Impact:**
- Competitor establishes category leadership
- IBM seen as follower, not innovator in AI workflow automation

### If IBM Partners Instead of Builds

**Option:** License technology from third party or acquire startup

**Pros:**
- Faster time to market (no development required)
- Lower upfront investment risk

**Cons:**
- No true competitive advantage (others can license too)
- Margin erosion from licensing fees (40-60% vs. 80% gross margin)
- Loss of intellectual property and long-term strategic control
- Less IBM brand differentiation

**Recommendation:** Build vs. buy/license - technology foundation already exists, investment modest, margins significantly higher
