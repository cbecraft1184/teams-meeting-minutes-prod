A health check timeout in Azure Container Apps (ACA) usually means the platform's orchestrator (Kubernetes under the hood) attempted to contact your container to see if it was running, but received no response within the allotted time.The most common causes generally fall into misconfiguration, application slowness, or resource constraints.1. Port & Network Misconfiguration (Most Common)If the health probe is knocking on the wrong door, it will time out waiting for an answer.Port Mismatch: The most frequent issue. Your container listens on a specific port (e.g., 3000), but the probe is configured to check the default HTTP port (80) or a different ingress port.Fix: Ensure targetPort in your Ingress settings matches the port your application code actually binds to.1Listening on Localhost only: Many modern web frameworks (like Flask, Express, or .NET) default to listening on 127.0.0.1 (localhost). In a containerized environment, localhost is not accessible from the outside (where the probe comes from).Fix: Configure your app to listen on 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces).Incorrect Protocol: You configured an HTTP probe, but your application requires HTTPS (or vice versa), causing the handshake to hang or fail.2. Slow Application Startup (Cold Starts)2Serverless containers can scale to zero. When a new instance spins up, it must load the OS, runtime, and your code before it can respond to a probe.Default Timeout Exceeded: ACA applies default health probes if you don't define them.3 If your app takes 10 seconds to start, but the default probe gives up after 2 seconds, it will fail and kill the container before it's ready.Dependency Blocking: If your application code attempts to connect to a database or external API before starting the web server (synchronous initialization), the probe will time out because the port isn't open yet.Fix: Use a dedicated Startup Probe with a high initialDelaySeconds to give your app "breathing room" to initialize before the Readiness/Liveness probes start checking.43. Resource ConstraintsCPU Throttling: If you allocated 0.25 vCPU but your application relies on a heavy framework (like Spring Boot or a large Node.js app), the startup process might be throttled so heavily that it cannot respond to the network request in time.Memory OOM (Out of Memory): If the app hits its memory limit during startup, it may freeze or crash silently just as the probe is checking it.4. "Hidden" Default ProbesA common trap in Azure Container Apps is the injected default probe.If you enable Ingress (allow traffic) but do not explicitly define a probe in your YAML/configuration, Azure automatically injects a TCP startup probe on your ingress port.The Trap: If your app starts listening on the port late in its startup sequence, this hidden TCP probe will fail, and Azure will restart your container repeatedly in a loop.Summary of Probe Types & FailuresProbe TypeWhat it checksTypical Timeout CauseConsequenceStartup"Has the app process started?"App takes too long to load libraries or connect to DB.Container is killed and restarted.Readiness"Can the app take traffic?"App is busy processing a heavy request or dependencies (DB) are down.Traffic is blocked (503 error), but container stays running.Liveness"Is the app stuck?"Deadlock, infinite loop, or "zombie" process.Container is killed and restarted.Troubleshooting StepsCheck Console Logs: Go to the Log Stream in the Azure Portal.5 Do you see "Application started on port X"? If you never see that message, your app is crashing or hanging before it even gets to the network stage.Verify Listening Address: Look for logs indicating Listening on http://127.0.0.1:80. If you see 127.0.0.1, change your start command to bind to 0.0.0.0.Increase Initial Delay: Manually configure a Startup Probe in the "Health Probes" section of the container configuration.6 Set Initial delay seconds to something generous (e.g., 10-30 seconds) to rule out slow startup.7Scale Up: Temporarily increase the vCPU/Memory allocation to see if the timeout disappears. If it does, your app was being throttled during boot.Next Step:Would you like me to write a specific probes configuration snippet (YAML) for your application that includes a "safe" startup delay? (If so, please let me know which language/framework you are using).
