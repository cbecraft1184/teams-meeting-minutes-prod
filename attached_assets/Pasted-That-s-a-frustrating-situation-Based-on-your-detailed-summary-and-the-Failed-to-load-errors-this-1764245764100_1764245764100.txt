That's a frustrating situation! Based on your detailed summary and the "Failed to load" errors, this is a very common issue with Microsoft Teams custom app development involving Single Sign-On (SSO). The fact that the UI loads but the API calls fail, and you see no requests hitting your backend logs, strongly points to a frontend/SSO token acquisition failure before the API call is even attempted.Given that you've already implemented the consensus solution ({ resources: [APP_ID_URI] }), let's methodically check the most probable remaining causes.🛠️ Teams SSO Troubleshooting: No Backend LogsThe most critical symptom is "There are NO request logs showing in Azure." This confirms the failure is happening client-side (in the Teams desktop/web client).1. Teams Client-Side Failure Check (The Silent Killer)The microsoftTeams.authentication.getAuthToken() call is likely failing silently in the frontend, preventing the API call from ever being made.Action: You need to add error handling to your getAuthToken call to see why it's failing.JavaScriptmicrosoftTeams.authentication.getAuthToken({ 
    resources: [APP_ID_URI] 
}).then((token) => {
    // Success: use token to call backend
    callBackendAPI(token);
}).catch((error) => {
    // CRITICAL: Log this error to the console and/or display in the UI.
    console.error("SSO Token Acquisition Failed:", error); 
    // This will reveal the exact cause (e.g., 'invalid_grant', 'consent_required')
});
What to look for in the error:invalid_grant or consent_required: Means the user hasn't consented yet, or the permissions are wrong. A pop-up/consent flow needs to be triggered.The audience is invalid: The APP_ID_URI in the manifest/frontend doesn't match the one configured in Azure AD.2. The Teams Manifest & Admin Center UpdateEven if your code is perfect, the Teams client might be using an outdated manifest containing the wrong permissions or AAD App ID.Problem: The Teams client aggressively caches the app manifest. Simply re-deploying your backend code won't update the manifest the client uses.Action 1 (Most Likely Fix): You must re-upload the updated Teams App Package (.zip file) to the Teams Admin Center or directly to the user's Teams client (e.g., via "Manage apps" $\rightarrow$ "Upload a custom app").Crucial Step: Increment the version number in your manifest.json (or appPackage/manifest.json). For example, change "version": "1.0.0" to "version": "1.0.1". Teams treats this as a brand new app update and forces a refresh.Action 2 (Cache Clearance): Completely clear the cache of your Teams desktop client.Desktop: Sign out, exit Teams completely, and delete all files in the %appdata%\Microsoft\Teams folder (or equivalent on Mac/Linux). Restart Teams.Web: Clear browser cache and cookies, then reload the app.3. Audience Mismatch Persistence (Backend Rejection)Although you don't see logs, if the token is acquired but is incorrect, the call might fail instantly, or the token is passed and the backend is rejecting it without logging.Check the Azure AD Application Settings:API Permissions: Verify the application has the correct delegated permissions enabled (e.g., User.Read and any custom scope defined for your API). Crucially, ensure Admin Consent has been granted for these permissions.Expose an API: Double-check that the Application ID URI used in your frontend's resources array (your APP_ID_URI) exactly matches the one defined in "Expose an API" $\rightarrow$ "Application ID URI" in your Azure AD app registration.Accepted Client Applications: Under "Expose an API," ensure you have added the correct Client IDs for the Teams mobile/desktop/web clients (which includes the specific ID 5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-7390ee780024 for the Teams web/desktop client) as pre-authorized applications.🔑 Recommended Next StepsAdd Error Logging: Implement the .catch((error) => ...) block in your frontend getAuthToken call. This will immediately tell you the root cause of the client-side failure.Force Manifest Update: Increment the version number in your Teams manifest, re-zip, and re-upload the application through the Teams Admin Center.Clear Cache: Force a refresh of your Teams client cache.
