This is an excellent use case for Microsoft Teams Single Sign-On (SSO) combined with the Microsoft Graph API. The proper configuration involves three core components to grant your application the necessary permissions to read the user's calendar data.

The user's Teams calendar is part of their Microsoft 365 data, and accessing it requires specific Microsoft Graph permissions.

1. 🔑 Required Microsoft Graph Permission
To pull scheduled meetings, your application must use the Microsoft Graph endpoint for calendar events: GET /me/events or GET /users/{id}/events. This requires a delegated permission.

Permission Name: Calendars.Read

Purpose: Allows the app to read events in the user's calendar.

2. ⚙️ Azure AD App Registration Configuration
You must add the required Graph permission to your Azure AD App registration.

Step-by-Step Configuration
Navigate to API Permissions: In the Azure Portal, open your App Registration → "API permissions".

Add Permission: Click "+ Add a permission".

Select Microsoft Graph: Choose "Microsoft Graph" → "Delegated permissions".

Add Calendars.Read: Search for and select Calendars.Read.

Grant Admin Consent: After adding the permission, click "Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]". This allows the user's token (exchanged via SSO) to include the necessary scope without requiring an explicit user consent pop-up for every user (assuming your organization supports it).

3. 🖥️ Teams Manifest and Frontend Code Configuration
You must request the Graph permission in both your Teams manifest and your frontend code.

A. Teams Manifest (manifest.json)
You need to declare the Graph permission in the webApplicationInfo block of your Teams manifest so that Teams knows what permissions the user is consenting to during installation.

JSON

"webApplicationInfo": {
  "id": "{YOUR_AAD_CLIENT_ID}",
  "resource": "api://your-domain.com/{YOUR_AAD_CLIENT_ID}", 
  "delegatedPermissions": [
      "User.Read",        // Standard for SSO identity
      "access_as_user",   // Your custom scope for your backend API
      "Calendars.Read"  // <-- REQUIRED FOR GRAPH CALENDAR ACCESS
  ],
  // ... other properties
},
B. Frontend SSO Token Acquisition Flow
The standard Teams SSO flow involves a two-step process to access Microsoft Graph:

Get Token for Your API: The frontend calls getAuthToken() to get a token (token A) scoped for your custom backend API (api://...).

JavaScript

microsoftTeams.authentication.getAuthToken({ resources: [APP_ID_URI] })
.then((tokenA) => {
    // Send token A to your backend server
});
Exchange Token for Graph Access (On-Behalf-Of Flow): Your backend server receives token A, validates it, and then exchanges it with the Microsoft identity platform for a new token (token B) that is scoped for the Microsoft Graph API. This exchange is the On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow.


Backend Request: Your server sends a request to the AAD token endpoint, using token A and requesting the following scope for the new token:

scope: "https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.Read" 
Result: AAD returns token B, which your backend uses to make the call to the Graph API.

C. The API Call
Your backend uses token B to query the user's calendar events:

// Example Microsoft Graph Call from your backend server
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/events?$select=subject,organizer,start,end
Authorization: Bearer <token B> 
The proper Teams SSO configuration to support syncing meetings is to implement the On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow on your backend, requesting the https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.Read scope during the token exchange.

Would you like me to focus on the necessary backend steps for implementing the On-Behalf-Of flow to successfully exchange the Teams SSO token for a Graph token?
