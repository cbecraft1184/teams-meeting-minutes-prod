how do you make a plugin for Microsoft Teams that shows up in the left sidebar menu in Microsoft Teams?
To create a "plugin" that appears in the left sidebar of Microsoft Teams, you need to develop a personal app with a static tab. This is essentially a web page embedded in an <iframe> within the Teams interface. 
The development process involves setting up a project, building your web application, configuring an app manifest, and uploading the app to Teams. 
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have:
A Microsoft 365 account with a developer tenant, where you have permission to upload custom apps (sideloading).
Node.js and npm installed.
Visual Studio Code with the Microsoft 365 & Teams Toolkit extension installed, which simplifies the process.

Development Steps
Create Your App Project: Use the Microsoft 365 & Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code to generate a project template.
Open VS Code and select the Microsoft 365 & Teams Toolkit icon in the Activity Bar.
Select Create a New App and follow the prompts to choose the Tab capability and set the scope to Personal.
Build Your Web Content: The core of your app is a webpage. The toolkit provides a basic structure.
Your tab's content will be displayed in an <iframe>.
You must include the Microsoft Teams JavaScript client library (TeamsJS) in your page and call microsoftTeams.app.initialize() after the page loads to ensure it functions correctly within Teams.
Configure the App Manifest: The manifest.json file is crucial. It describes your app to Teams.
In the manifest, the staticTabs array defines your personal tab.
Ensure the scope is set to personal.
The contentUrl property specifies the HTTPS URL of the webpage you want to display.
The toolkit often manages this configuration automatically when you select the "personal" scope.
Test and Debug Locally: The Toolkit allows you to run your app locally (often using a tunneling service like ngrok) in a browser-based version of Teams for testing.
Package and Upload the App: Once your app is ready, you need to create an app package (a zip file containing the manifest and icons).
Use the toolkit or the gulp manifest command to generate the package.
In the Teams client, go to Apps, select Manage your apps, and choose Upload a custom app.
Upload the generated zip file.
Pin the App: After the app is uploaded, it appears in the "More added apps" menu (...).
Right-click the app icon and select Pin to keep it in the left sidebar for easy access. 
For organizational-wide deployment, a Teams administrator can use app setup policies in the Teams admin center to pre-pin the app for specific users or the entire organization.
