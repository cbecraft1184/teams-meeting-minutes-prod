# NAVY ERP Meeting Minutes - Demo Pilot Documentation

**IMPORTANT: This is DEMO PILOT documentation, not production deployment.**

## What This Is

A 20-person proof-of-concept demonstration for NAVY ERP to evaluate an AI-powered meeting minutes system for Microsoft Teams.

## What This Is NOT

- NOT a production system
- NOT for 300,000 users  
- NOT for Department of Defense-wide deployment
- NOT a 16-month enterprise project
- NOT requiring full ATO/FedRAMP compliance

## Pilot Scope

- **Participants:** Maximum 20 NAVY ERP team members
- **Duration:** 4-6 weeks
- **Environment:** Azure Commercial (East US)
- **Purpose:** Validate concept before considering production
- **Data:** Demo/test data only (no classified information)

## Demo Objectives

1. Prove automatic Teams meeting capture works
2. Demonstrate AI-generated minutes quality
3. Test approval workflow usability
4. Validate SharePoint integration
5. Collect participant feedback

## Success Metrics

- Capture 5+ demo meetings successfully
- AI minutes require minimal editing
- Participants rate system as "useful"
- Technical integrations work reliably
- Positive go/no-go decision for production consideration

## If Pilot Succeeds

THEN (and only then) consider:
- Production deployment planning
- ATO/compliance process
- Scale architecture for wider NAVY use
- GCC High migration
- Integration with production systems

## Documentation Note

Some files in this folder may reference enterprise-scale features, production timelines, or large user bases. **Disregard those references.** This is a focused demo pilot with 20 participants to prove the concept.
