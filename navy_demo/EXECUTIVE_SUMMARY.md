# NAVY ERP Meeting Minutes Demo - Executive Summary

## Overview

This is a 4-6 week proof-of-concept demonstration for 20 NAVY ERP personnel using the ABC123987.onmicrosoft.com tenant. The system automatically captures Microsoft Teams meetings, generates AI-powered meeting minutes using Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o), manages review and approval workflow, and archives to SharePoint. The demo validates whether AI automation can save 30-60 minutes per meeting while improving decision tracking and knowledge management for NAVY ERP operations.

The pilot runs on Azure Commercial (East US) with demo data only—no classified information, no production integration, and no ATO required. Success criteria include 100% meeting capture rate, 80%+ AI accuracy requiring minimal editing, and 8/10 user satisfaction. If the pilot proves value, production deployment would require a separate 6-12 month effort including ATO process, GCC High migration, and IL4/IL5 compliance assessment. At the end of Week 6, leadership will make a go/no-go decision based on demonstrated time savings, user adoption, and operational impact metrics.
