# Technology Stack Summary

The solution is built as a full-stack TypeScript application with a React frontend using Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS for the interface, TanStack Query for real-time data synchronization, and Wouter for client-side routing. The backend runs on Node.js with Express, uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for data persistence, and implements a durable job queue for reliable background processing. Microsoft Graph API provides seamless Teams integration through webhook subscriptions that capture meeting recordings and transcripts, while Azure OpenAI Service powers the AI capabilities using GPT-4o for intelligent minutes generation and Whisper for audio transcription. The entire infrastructure runs on Azure Commercial Cloud (App Service, PostgreSQL Flexible Server, Azure OpenAI, Key Vault, Application Insights) with Azure Active Directory handling authentication and role-based access control, creating a secure, scalable, and enterprise-ready meeting automation platform that processes natural language, extracts action items, and maintains searchable meeting archives with minimal human intervention.
